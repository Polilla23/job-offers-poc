# job-offers-poc
App that consumes JSearch API to obtain job offers.

It has functional search, nearby, and popular jobs features. Each job is selectable, leading to a page with its details. In the footer, you can add it to favorites (this part still needs development) and apply for the job (opens a Chrome tab with the data).

The app was built using React Native and Expo (router, linking)
